   my $tx = shift;
   if($tx->req->server_port == 400
   && $tx->req->client_port == 500)
   {

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple procedural interface to L<AnyEvent::Ident::Client> and
L<AnyEvent::Ident::Server>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 ident_server $hostname, $port, $callback

Start an ident server listening to the address given by C<$hostname>
on port C<$port>.  For each request C<$callback> will be called and
passed in an instance of L<AnyEvent::Ident::Transaction>.

=head2 ident_client $hostname, $port, $server_port, $client_port, $callback

Make an ident request with the ident server at C<$hostname> on port C<$port>
with the given port pair C<$server_port,$client_port>.  When the response
comes back call C<$callback>, with an instance of L<AnyEvent::Ident::Response>.

=head1 WHY

Why use this distribution instead of L<Net::Ident>?

=item *

Works under Windows (MSWin32)

L<Net::Ident> installs (even passing its tests) on Windows, but it does not work.
It may not work in some UNIX environments depending on your headers and libraries.

=item *

Works with L<AnyEvent>

This distribution will work with any event loop supported by L<AnyEvent>.

=item *

Server Included

This distribution comes with a server, which is handy for testing (take a
peek at the test suite for L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Ident> to see what I mean.
